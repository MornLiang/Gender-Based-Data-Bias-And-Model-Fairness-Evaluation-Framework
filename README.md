# Gender-Based-Data-Bias-And-Model-Fairness-Evaluation-Framework

A systematic machine learning fairness evaluation framework integrating gender-based data bias quantification (via Earth Mover's Distance) and model-level fairness assessment. 
- **Extensive Validation**: Tested on 74 disease prediction datasets across 7 machine learning algorithms and 2 fairness metrics (Equalised Odds and Treatment Equality).
- **Key Finding**: Reveals the critical role of mitigating data bias in enhancing model fairness.
- **Significance**: Contributes to the development of equitable healthcare AI and supports robust informed decision-making.
